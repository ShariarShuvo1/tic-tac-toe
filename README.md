This is a fun Project where I try to build **Tic Tac Toe** game in different GUI framework and language. 

I  also try to make them look as simmilar as possible.

All the game share same firebase backend. 

This game has 3 mode.

1. Player Vs Compute
2. Player Vs Player
3. Online

All The Mode are working. 

**Currently I have developped in:**

# 1. React + Typescript + Tailwind

# 2. Android Studio with Java (Old version)

**I have plan to develop in:**

# 1. PyQt6

# 2. Flutter


All these GUI will share same backend, so it will be possible to crossplay.
